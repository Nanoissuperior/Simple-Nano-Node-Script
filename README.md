# nano node script
A script to setup a nano node

Following docs.nano.org guide to setup a node can be confusing for some. 
This script involves running only a couple lines of code and will leave you with a fully synced node.


This script will install server requirements, pull the latest docker image and download a synced ledger with some nice feedback along the way. 


1) Download
2) chmod +x nodesetup.sh
3) ./nodesetup.sh
