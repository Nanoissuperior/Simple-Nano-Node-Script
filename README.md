# Simple Nano Node Script
### A script to setup a nano node

Following docs.nano.org guide to setup a node can be confusing for some. This script will install server requirements, pull the latest docker image and download a synced ledger with some nice feedback along the way. 
(Script based on Ubuntu Server running as a sudo user)

1) Download
2) `chmod +x nodesetup.sh`
3) `./nodesetup.sh`
4) Enjoy

You will receive some prompts along the way, respond to these when needed.

- Please note you should only use this script from a trusted source. 
- You are responsible for the results of running this scipt on your server.
- If you get stuck find me on discord and tell me.
